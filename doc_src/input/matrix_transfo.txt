@defgroup matrix_transfo Operations on Poses

@brief This page introduces vocabulary for referring to operations on @f$ SE(3) @f$ poses (also called @f$ SE(3) @f$ transformations).

Let us consider three @f$ SE(3) @f$ rigid transformations, denoted by @f$ (x,X) @f$, @f$ (y,Y) @f$, and @f$ (z,Z) @f$, where lowercase variables denote translations, and uppercase letters denote rotations. Variables @f$ x @f$, @f$ y @f$, and @f$ z @f$ are thus three-vectors, while @f$ X @f$, @f$ Y @f$, and @f$ Z @f$ are 3D rotations encoded as rotation matrices.

<b>Note: Do not assume that lowercase variables <em>always</em> denote three-vectors. Throughout the doc, lowercase variables are also used to denote an @f$ SE(3) @f$ transformation (composed of a translation <em>and</em> a rotation).</b>

Let us consider that the three transformations @f$ (x,X) @f$, @f$ (y,Y) @f$, and @f$ (z,Z) @f$ are related by
@f[ z = Xy+x \qquad Z=XY. @f]
Each transformation can be expressed from the other two as
@f{align*}{
z &= Xy+x & Z&=XY   &\textrm{(1)}\\
y &= X^T(z-x) & Y&=X^TZ &\textrm{(2)}\\
x &= z - ZY^Ty & X &= ZY^T &\textrm{(3)}
@f}
Each of the three rearrangements above define a way of combining two @f$ SE(3)  @f$ elements into a third   @f$ SE(3) @f$ element.

In the first operation
@f[ z = Xy+x \qquad Z=XY @f]
we say that @f$ (y,Y) @f$ is <em>transformed</em> by @f$ (x,X) @f$ to produce @f$ (z,Z) @f$.

In
@f[ y = X^T(z-x) \qquad Y=X^TZ @f]
@f$ (z,Z) @f$ is <em>projected</em> onto @f$ (x,X) @f$ to produce @f$ (y,Y) @f$ (@f$ (y,Y) @f$ is the projection of @f$ (z,Z) @f$ in the coordinate system defined by @f$ (x,X) @f$).

The last operation
@f[ x = z - ZY^Ty \qquad X = ZY^T @f]
computes @f$ (x,X) @f$ which is the transformation that applies @f$ (y,Y) @f$ onto @f$ (z,Z) @f$.
